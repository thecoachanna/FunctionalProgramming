# FunctionalProgramming
Functional Programming in JavaScript:

 A series of interactive exercises for learning Microsoft's Reactive Extensions (Rx) Library for Javascript. Functional programming provides developers with the tools to abstract common collection operations into reusable, composable building blocks. Most of the operations you perform on collections can be accomplished with five simple functions:

1. map
2. filter
3. concatAll
4. reduce
5. zip

If you learn these 5 functions your code will become shorter, more self-descriptive, and more durable. You'll learn that these five functions hold the key to simplifying asynchronous programming. Once you've finished this tutorial you'll also have all the tools you need to easily avoid race conditions, propagate and handle asynchronous errors, and sequence events and AJAX requests. In short, these 5 functions will probably be the most powerful, flexible, and useful functions you'll ever learn.
